OSGi has been a mature framework for building modular applications for quite some time. It has however, not not been embraced fully by the development community. The primary reason it stays unpopular in the development arena lies in its lack of beginning level tutorials or classes. This tutorial begins a series of labs to demystify the OSGi framework and begin familiarity with Apache Felix.

This lab shows how to register a service bundle using blueprint services. The intent is to give the developer some options especially if dependency injection is needed prior to bundle registration.

## Audience 
The core audience is seated in a comfortable classroom or conference room environment. Readers performing this tutorial have received an overview of OSGi and completed a previous lab in which we setup a framework for use. A reader performing this tutorial would have a printed version of this media or the web site up on one screen while they work on code in another. The audience can be made up of developers from different disciplines but knowledge and understanding of the Java language is assumed.
