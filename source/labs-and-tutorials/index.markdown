As a part of us sharing the love in a classroom environment. We also have publicy available labs and tutorials that you can do anywhere and anytime. We try not to couple these too strongly with a specific technology or IDE, but occasionally we will require special tooling in which case we will should provide the links to them. All of our labs start from the ground up, usually with a download of a specific framework or library so an internet connection may be required on the majority of them.

If your not taking the class, not to worry, the labs are somewhat stand-alone and don't require anything but a basic knowledge of the subject.

## OSGi Tutorials
These were added to support training on OSGi fundamentals and creating Bundles in Java using Apache Felix.

## Apache Jackrabbit Tutorials
These tutorials attempt to show the APIs exposed by JSR-170 and JSR-283 and how to programmatically use them in a Java context.
