I just added a new video to the programmer vs world channel (sorry I still haven't set up the one for this site yet).
For some reason the phrase

> all bundles are singleton unless told otherwise

wasn't reitereated enough for me when I first started, or maybe I just skimmed too much of the documentation. Either way,
I suffered great peril until I got my head around it and how to change that behaviour when you need to. The answer is much simplier than you might think.

I put the sample code from this video on [github](https://github.com/PlasmaTrout/ca-servicefactory-demo) if you want to take a closer look at it and keep your eye on the [PvW youTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXUMchScrOIZYUa9_6wmFTg) for more.
