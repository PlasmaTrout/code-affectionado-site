Some things were updated and added this week:

First of all there is a [new video tutorial](https://youtu.be/nb9E6o9-UJs) on multiple cardinality references and filtering. For those of you that may have done the ones in the OSGi section, this one covers the Maven/SCR Annotation method instead of BndTools. It does run long (sorry) at 47 minutes. In fairness though, it does cover about 4 tutorials worth of information. I promise not to make them this long again.

Secondly the [Apache Sling section](/labs-and-tutorials/sling/) has been opened. So far only one [starting from scratch](/labs-and-tutorials/sling/starting-from-scratch) tutorial is in there, but we all have to start somewhere :)

Lastly, there is a new reference area in both the [OSGi](/labs-and-tutorials/osgi/) area and the [Apache Sling](/labs-and-tutorials/sling/) Area (Jackrabbit is coming). My intent is not only to give you some links to references I use for a particular subject but to provde some content to provide a more user friendly explanation of some of the things I've learned. I hope I succeed.

Enjoy and have a great week!
