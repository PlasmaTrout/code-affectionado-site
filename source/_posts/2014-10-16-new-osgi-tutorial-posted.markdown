In a [previous osgi tutorial](/labs-and-tutorials/osgi/apache-felix-scr-annotations) we built a project and tested it utilizing maven. While maven is easy for making simple bundles, it becomes difficult to manage when projects
have many bundles or when projects separate their API and Implementations frequently.

A product called Bndtools streamlines the building of OSGi components and provides a significant number of  tools that help in this arena. In this [new Bndtools tutorial](/labs-and-tutorials/osgi/apache-felix-maven-to-bndtools) the original simple greeter service is going to be rebuilt from scratch as a Bndtools project.

The [OSGi Tutorial Page](/labs-and-tutorials/osgi/) has been updated with this tutorial as well.
