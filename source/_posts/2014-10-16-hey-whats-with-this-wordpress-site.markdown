Just in case you noticed, there is a Wordpress site out there with the same name as this site. It's still me though. No one is plagiarizing or copying the content off this site...yet. As a matter of fact, the Wordpress site was an experiment I was conducting to see what the writing experience was like for not only me but possibly collaborators. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good experience.

To make matters worse, the search engine integration on the other site isn't very keen either. This site, for instance, frequently shows up in the top ten for specific tutorial searches while a Wordpress site with the exact same content doesn't. The majority of people hitting this site are coming from searches so that's not going to cut it.

What does this all mean? Well, in a nutshell, _I am going to start writing more tutorials_ and I needed to settle into a set of tools that I will be doing them in. Before I got too busy, I thought that I would examine the other options. Overall, though, this site is much better prepared to do the job.

By the way, I do read the comments, I'm just really awful about replying. I really appreciate all of the positive things you guys have said. If you have any suggestions for topics you would like to see, feel free to comment in the [labs and tutorials](/labs-and-tutorials/) section and let me know. I have started outlining some Apache Sling tutorials and have the resources to put together Hadoop tutorials as well, but the sky is the limit. That being said, I need to get writing on of them.
