    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just in case you noticed, there is a Wordpress site out there with the same name as this site. It&rsquo;s still me though. No one is plagiarizing or copying the content off this site&hellip;yet. As a matter of fact, the Wordpress site was an experiment I was conducting to see what the writing experience was like for not only me but possibly collaborators. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t a very good experience.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the search engine integration on the other site isn&rsquo;t very keen either. This site, for instance, frequently shows up in the top ten for specific tutorial searches while a Wordpress site with the exact same content doesn&rsquo;t. The majority of people hitting this site are coming from searches so that&rsquo;s not going to cut it.</p>

<p>What does this all mean? Well, in a nutshell, <em>I am going to start writing more tutorials</em> and I needed to settle into a set of tools that I will be doing them in. Before I got too busy, I thought that I would examine the other options. Overall, though, this site is much better prepared to do the job.</p>

<p>By the way, I do read the comments, I&rsquo;m just really awful about replying. I really appreciate all of the positive things you guys have said. If you have any suggestions for topics you would like to see, feel free to comment in the <a href="http://www.codeaffectionado.com/labs-and-tutorials/">labs and tutorials</a> section and let me know. I have started outlining some Apache Sling tutorials and have the resources to put together Hadoop tutorials as well, but the sky is the limit. That being said, I need to get writing on of them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://www.codeaffectionado.com/labs-and-tutorials/osgi/apache-felix-scr-annotations">previous osgi tutorial</a> we built a project and tested it utilizing maven. While maven is easy for making simple bundles, it becomes difficult to manage when projects
have many bundles or when projects separate their API and Implementations frequently.</p>

<p>A product called Bndtools streamlines the building of OSGi components and provides a significant number of  tools that help in this arena. In this <a href="http://www.codeaffectionado.com/labs-and-tutorials/osgi/apache-felix-maven-to-bndtools">new Bndtools tutorial</a> the original simple greeter service is going to be rebuilt from scratch as a Bndtools project.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.codeaffectionado.com/labs-and-tutorials/osgi/">OSGi Tutorial Page</a> has been updated with this tutorial as well.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love to watch programming related presentations online, it&rsquo;s sad, but I love it. I typically put these on during my hour commute to and from work and just listen. I did however, run across a presentation from a google conference a few years ago that made me go home and actually watch the presentation. It was Douglas Crockford&rsquo;s &ldquo;JavaScript: The Good Parts&rdquo; presentation. The reason I started over was I didn&rsquo;t get very far into listening when I realized I had a problem.</p>

<p>Early into &ldquo;The Good Parts&rdquo; Doug said something to the extent of &ldquo;JavaScript is a language that people jump in and think they know, but don&rsquo;t&rdquo;. Only a few minutes later into the presentation after some examples, I had an epiphany. I was one of those people. I had just jumped into the language and treated it like Java. It&rsquo;s an utter miracle that my stuff every worked. I decided to start over and take the language and patterns very, very seriously.</p>

<p>Here is a compiled playlist of the important sections of his talks starting from the very origins of JavaScript all the way to advanced usages.</p>

<p>Take the time to watch this whole playlist. I promise you it will make you better in the long run. If at the very least at code reviews.</p>
