    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love to watch programming related presentations online, it&rsquo;s sad, but I love it. I typically put these on during my hour commute to and from work and just listen. I did however, run across a presentation from a google conference a few years ago that made me go home and actually watch the presentation. It was Douglas Crockford&rsquo;s &ldquo;JavaScript: The Good Parts&rdquo; presentation. The reason I started over was I didn&rsquo;t get very far into listening when I realized I had a problem.</p>

<p>Early into &ldquo;The Good Parts&rdquo; Doug said something to the extent of &ldquo;JavaScript is a language that people jump in and think they know, but don&rsquo;t&rdquo;. Only a few minutes later into the presentation after some examples, I had an epiphany. I was one of those people. I had just jumped into the language and treated it like Java. It&rsquo;s an utter miracle that my stuff every worked. I decided to start over and take the language and patterns very, very seriously.</p>

<p>Here is a compiled playlist of the important sections of his talks starting from the very origins of JavaScript all the way to advanced usages.</p>

<p>Take the time to watch this whole playlist. I promise you it will make you better in the long run. If at the very least at code reviews.</p>
