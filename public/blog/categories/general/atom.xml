    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know it&rsquo;s been quiet for a while since the last update, and that&rsquo;s going to change. It just took a while to setup for the new additions
to the site. It took longer than I expected to purchase the software and equipment needed to take this to the next level.</p>

<p>So whats in the works, well, for starters video tutorials. There will be more of those for sure. My first few attempts went into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXUMchScrOIZYUa9_6wmFTg">Programmer Vs World youtube channel</a>, but I think I may move them to a dedicated codeaffectionado channel soon.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example (I made a <a href="http://localhost:4000/labs-and-tutorials/osgi/">special area</a> in the OSGi tutorial page for these):</p>

<p>Also, myself and a few friends have started getting ready to start a podcast.
We&rsquo;ve done some sample takes and think we&rsquo;ve got a format that can be fun and educational all at the same time. We did some test episodes but we should have the real show cranking up in late June. I&rsquo;ll post the link on here when it starts.</p>

<p>Lastly the site has needed a makeover for quite a while. I&rsquo;ve been running with the stock theme for far too long. Thanks to <a href="http://annekjohnson.com/">Anne Johnson</a> for the theme.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the next tutorial? Well I received a ton of questions about how to build JSP applications for Felix/BndTools, so I thought we would start there. I have the materials complete, I just need a play to put a zip file of all of the BndTools items you will need first. I also recieved some questions on logging as well and we will tackle that too.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for being patient the last few months and game on!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just in case you noticed, there is a Wordpress site out there with the same name as this site. It&rsquo;s still me though. No one is plagiarizing or copying the content off this site&hellip;yet. As a matter of fact, the Wordpress site was an experiment I was conducting to see what the writing experience was like for not only me but possibly collaborators. Unfortunately, it wasn&rsquo;t a very good experience.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the search engine integration on the other site isn&rsquo;t very keen either. This site, for instance, frequently shows up in the top ten for specific tutorial searches while a Wordpress site with the exact same content doesn&rsquo;t. The majority of people hitting this site are coming from searches so that&rsquo;s not going to cut it.</p>

<p>What does this all mean? Well, in a nutshell, <em>I am going to start writing more tutorials</em> and I needed to settle into a set of tools that I will be doing them in. Before I got too busy, I thought that I would examine the other options. Overall, though, this site is much better prepared to do the job.</p>

<p>By the way, I do read the comments, I&rsquo;m just really awful about replying. I really appreciate all of the positive things you guys have said. If you have any suggestions for topics you would like to see, feel free to comment in the <a href="/labs-and-tutorials/">labs and tutorials</a> section and let me know. I have started outlining some Apache Sling tutorials and have the resources to put together Hadoop tutorials as well, but the sky is the limit. That being said, I need to get writing on of them.</p>
